The text tells us that not all companies have the same ownership rights.
These rights may vary depending on the size of the company and the country in which it is located.
In a limited liability company, the owners are only liable for the amount they have invested in the business.
In companies with unlimited liability, the owners are fully liable for the debts of the company.
Unlimited liability companies are divided into individual entrepreneurs and general partnership.
In the first case, the organization is owned by one person, and in the second case by two or more.
We are also told about the type of companies called franchises.
This is the type of company in which the business owner allows others to use the trademark, products and reputation of his company.
